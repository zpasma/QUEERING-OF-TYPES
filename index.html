            <h1> Abstract</h1>
            <p>Throughout the history of the built environment there have been architectural types. From the earliest known representations of civilization and their typification of structures to the appropriation of certain ‘types’ of spaces meaning certain ‘types’ of things in social space and culture. While a useful system for understanding and potentially solving design problems in the built environment; the system in itself is an assumptive process inevitably contributing to stereotypes of architectural form and function in society. It’s clear that typeness is deeply rooted in the infrastructure of the architectural world… but in order to further advocate for the inclusion and diversity of both architectural spaces and the individuals inhabiting them, new strategies need to be explored! Through the “queering” of typological space varied instances of typologies in architecture can be pursued. Through the act of understanding, dramatizing and implementing varied functional (societal) and formal (architectural) strategies architectural typologies can be “queered” - affording a more expansive range of possible performances and architectural conditions. In this way they can act to challenge the process of creating both typologies and their sub-types, perhaps altering the way in which they are established and adopted in the first place. This architectural thesis exploration is in the hope of providing a more formidable system of design and spatial experience that is meant to prioritize difference, uniqueness, and social representation in society.</p>

            <h1> Context </h1>


             <p> Typological thinking in architectural theory and discourse has existed since the earliest known attempts to associate objects together using systems of classification. Perhaps grouped through physical form or appearance, immaterial associations, or some other justification of sensory experience, typologies established a logical system of association and classification within the built environment. While today the term ‘typology’ is most often associated with a building typology (in regard to programmatic functions/spaces), a typology of architecture (in regard to a combination of built environments/experiences), or perhaps some other typology of space (in regard to a spatial/contextual condition) the terminology has not changed much from the early studies of Quatremere de Quincy, J.N.L Durand, Aldo Rossi, and Oswald Mathias Ungers (to name a few). Today, typologies still serve as the buildings blocks for conceptualising ideas and configuring space in architectural terms. As paraphrased by Quatremere de Quincy’s definition of typology;
             </p>

             <h3>WHAT REALLY IS A TYPOLOGY THOUGH!?</h3>

             <a href="#quote1" class="quote" style=color:blue>“What then is a type? It can most simply be defined as a concept which describes a group of objects characterized by the same formal structure. It is neither a spatial diagram nor the average of a serial list. It is fundamentally based on the possibility of grouping objects by certain inherent structural similarities,” (1*) </a>
            
             <p>Prior to the architectural thinking of Modernism theory of typology in the early 1950s, philosophers, scientists, and architects of the Enlightenment used typologies as a means of understanding and modeling after other “like” objects. Initially formulated by Marc-Antoine Laugier in 1713-1796 in his Essai sur l’architecture, the concept of typology was used to conceptualize the primitive hut and its likeness to rational elements and standards. The vertical trees of the hut become “types” of columns, while the horizontal branches were likened to beams or roofs. Later on these thoughts became crucial for the work of Quatremere de Quincy in typological thinking. The concept of “type” was essential in conceiving thoughts surrounding the varied aspects of type. As explained in Quincy in his essay “Type”,  
             </p>

             <a href="quote2" class="quote" style=color:blue>“The model is a form to be copied or imitated: ‘all is precise and given in the model’. Type, on the contrary, is something that can act as a basis for the conception of works, which bear no resemblance to one another: ‘ all is more or less vague in the type’.”(2*)</a>

             <p>This metaphorical theory of type is one of the first introduced within modern architectural theory and discourse. Quincy’s work explored the conceptualization of type based on origin, transformation, and invention. ADD MORE*
             </p>

             <h3>IS THIS OKAY??</h3>

            <p>Through the process of observing, classifying, and demarcating, typologies are just inherently biased understandings of historical ideas and concepts. It’s clear that certain spaces have inherent social structures and attitudes within them… but what if these attitudes are situating only “prescriptive” functions and/or activities? Much like Robin Evans expresses in his essay ‘Figures, Doors, and Passages’ in regard to the separation of space via the corridor;</p>

            <a href="quote3" class="quote" style=color:blue>“The integration of household space was now for the sake of beauty; it’s separation was for convenience --  a opposition which has since become deeply engraved into theory, creating two distinct standards of judgement for two quite separate realities: On the one hand, an extended concatenation of spaces to flatten the eye (the most easily deceived of the senses , according to contemporary writers); on the other, a careful containment and individual compartments in which to preserve the self from others...The split between an architecture to look through and an architecture to hide in cut an unbridgeable gap dividing commodity from delight, utility from beauty, and function from form.” (3*)</a>

            <p>Through the integration of the corridor as a formal structure and organizing strategy a reinterpretation of domestic space became an inherently social dilemma; one concerned with ‘service’ spaces or the hiding of specific activities to fit within a specific social ‘type’. In this way the structuring of typologies can often situate social stereotypes within formally built environments. This contributes to certain groups being isolated and/or unjustly stereotyped within typologies of space.<br>

            <br>In the case of ‘Figures, Doors, and Passages’ the structuring of an organizational system within the domestic sphere of living literally built walls between social groups and types of interactions; as a result conditioning a social stereotype of space.<br>
        
            <br>While types of buildings are often justified through the means of technology and engineering via building codes, life safety, architectural regulations, etc. what if certain types of buildings could be other things all together? Could the socio-cultural implications of built typologies of space be contributing to a continuum of stereotypes and copies? Or is this simply the system with which the built environment must be furthered and explored? While one of the most prominent ways to conceptualize and perceive new architecture is through known typological thinking and strategies, what if this system is providing a bias from historical ideals compounding onto a never ending implementation of architectural copy and pasting? What if understanding architecture through typologies is actually inhibiting unknown explorations and experiments in the built environment?</p>

            <h3> ARE WE JUST COPYING + PASTING!?</h3>

            <br>

        <hr class="solid_white">
            <h1> Perception + Societal Functions </h1>

            <p>Architectural typologies are entangled in social constructs; they derive from them, but also formalize them. Only through analyzing the system that establishes the typology and the way in which it’s posited in society can we begin to potentially introduce new ‘queered’ instances of space  among known typologies. Much like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri express in their book ‘Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire’ in regard to the production of the “common” (otherwise known as societal norms and habits);</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“What it produces, in fact, is ‘common’, and that common we share serves as the basis for future production, in a spiral, expansive relationship… we can communicate only on the basis of language, symbols, ideas, and relationships we share in common, and in turn the results of our communication are new common languages, symbols, ideas, and relationships,”(4*)</a>

            <p>It’s only possible to begin establishing a new language when in fact a language is already known and understood. So in very much the same methodology -- the only way to begin to introduce new queered instances of typologies is through understanding the types that are used (and misused) currently. By exploring these currently known strategies for perceiving and establishing typologies in architecture then perhaps the system can be used to create new ways to conceptualize and define the system. As explained by Rafael Moneo in MIT Press’s 1978 issue of ‘Oppositions’,</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“Architecture, however - the world of objects created by architecture - is not only described by types, it is also produced through them...the architect is initially trapped by the type because it is the way they know. Later, they can act on it; can destroy it, transform it, respect it. The design process is a way of bringing the elements of a typology - the idea of a formal structure - into the precise state that characterizes the single work,” (5*).</a>

            <p>The perceptual factor of this understanding is essential in the way in which types are adhered to and recognized within social contexts. Yet, how does one define the process with which an individual perceives and understand both societal and architectural conditions? According to the post-structuralist Pierre Bourdeau in the field of human consciousness, practise and society, the habitus is a set of personally held dispositions around which a person’s thought and activities are structured. Excerpted from Architectural Historian John Archer’s Social Theory of Space, the habitus accounts for two varied conditions;</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“First, the spatial form as an apparatus through which people establish identity and articulate social relations; and second, the enduring capacity of buildings to sustain, protect, and perpetuate those identities and social relations,” (6*). </a>

            <p>The habitus delves in an individual’s “cognitive and motivating structures” which that individual then uses to “construct spatial knowledge and initiate activity”. So the study of an individual's spatial relationships and actions in space (i.e. the habitus) could otherwise be termed as the product of that individual’s particular social functions; or perhaps that person’s TYPOLOGY of social functions. In this way predispositions of space (stereotypes) inherently impact and constitute the socio-economic condition of that individual in space. While some spaces are regulatory and adopted by a variety of groups, sometimes others are not and as a result can perpetuate the uncommon conditions of that space in society.<br>
            <br>Different people have different conceptual understandings of typologies of space at various scales. Typologies of space (or the person’s habitus) directly impacts the way in which the space is circulated and how objects are interacted with. Why then… are there similar ‘types’ of spaces? 21st century coffee shops for example seemingly perpetuate a stereotypical condition of use. Their implementation of bright/simple graphics, clean materials and furniture, and calm/playful social interactions constitute a type of space. Yet, why is this true? Since individuals have varying habitus’ why are certain types of social space (in this case coffee shops) grouped in such a way and associated together? I’m sure there are business or marketing centered goals in the development of a particular ‘aesthetic’ or ‘vibe’ but even so why are individuals confronted and regulated with these terms in social spaces? According to Archer;</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“Within a given social context one’s habitus -- the set of dispositions that one may hold individually or in common with members of various groups and strata - is reinforced by recognizing the potentials and limits in the built environment that engage those dispositions,” (6*).</a>

            <p>In this way, it could simply be due to the fact that spaces within which habitus is developed and created, is oftentimes framed by or reinforced within constructs of the built environment and social interactions. What if in fact the environment where the activity is occurring and the social condition of the space is established are just components of the overall reinforcement of social norms? Could the way in which space is utilised and interacted with or in other words the TYPOLOGY of space be the true culprit of these conditions? What if space - and in fact the way space is used or perhaps not used - is the reason why certain programmes continue to perform in the same fashion. What characteristics would then influence these types of spatial conditions? According to Bourdieu from Archer’s text;</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“Type, orientation, plan, volume, scale, enclosure, light, color, and pattern first articulate, and then sustain, such dimensions of human life as consciousness, identity, occupation, status, gender, wealth, class, caste, and religion,” (6*).</a>

            <p>So in a way an object’s context within space or it’s known function, orientation, operability, etc. constitutes a known condition that is then adopted by society. So what would happen if the conditions that would usually normalize the space or social condition, are instead taken away? Like Archer said, what if the usual potentials and limits of the space that are used to reinforce its “space-ness” are destroyed all together? What would that mean for the space's possible use?</p>

        <hr class="solid_white">
            <h1> Social Objects </h1>

            <p>Along this trajectory of understanding the potentials and limits of objects in space...we must first explore architectural types fundamentally as objects in the first place.<br>
            
            <br>As termed by Bill Hillier in his essay, ‘The Space is the Machine’, in a typological sense architecture can be fundamentally perceived as an object. The dualities of the object is in its combination as a physical/spatial form as well as a bodily/cultural function of society. While there are external conditions to an object, its structure, materials, finishes, etc. combined with its natural social function you simply have an assembly of materials into a ‘construction’. As exemplified by Hillier, a Doric column has a number of elements; its plinth, pedestal, shaft, capital etc. all governed by their vertical relation to the law of gravity. Yet, while the ‘construction’ of this particular column would still function were one of its parts replaced, it would then lack its original ‘doricness’. As Hillier says,</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“If, for example, we were to replace the doric capital with an ionian capital, the effect on the construction would be negligible, but the effect on the ‘doricness’ of the ensemble would be devastating,” (7*).</a>

            <p>So while ‘doricness’ is clearly not governed by the construction or the simple assembly of parts, what is it due to then -- what defines it’s  ‘doricness’? It’s clear that the assembly of parts has a clear impact on the overall understanding of the object but what exactly defines this? Hillier goes on to express that once there is consideration to the object’s climatically malleable spatial form (i.e. understanding that the internal space is volumetric) in context to its societal cultural function you establish a configuration of socially patterned spaces (i.e. a programmatic space and/or building). The configuration of these socially patterned spaces inherent to the object then establishes different types of socio-cultural as well as physical spatial interactions between users. Within a given type of program this can completely alter the way in which the function of spaces can take place.</p>

            <h1> Design Experiment: Typology of Domestic Spaces</h1>

            <p>Kit-Houses of the 1930s are one of the first known examples of typological thinking in the realm of domestically mass-produced homes in the United States. The Harris catalog of house plans offered in 1920 contained a variety of these mass-produced bungalow style homes. Most plan layouts were on the minimal side of just 624 sq. ft. which included a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and two bedrooms. The M-1022 model was one of these such homes that exemplified early modernist theory surrounding typological thinking in the domestic sphere. Typology in modernist architectural theory was used as a means to conceptualize and digest spatial relationships into the justification of classifications. Much like Le

        <hr class="solid_white">
            <h1> Furniture Study: Typology of Social Functions + Objects</h1>

            <p>The Rietveld Chair (later referred to as the Red-Blue Chair) was initially designed using common nominal pieces of lumber that could be bought at a local hardware store and built using basic means of assembly with hammer and nail. Rietveld did so in the hope that the chair could potentially be mass-produced for the common public consumer.Since its creation, the chair has since become an icon for both kit-of-parts design as well as the Dutch de Stijl movement of the 1920s. As a bi-product of its creation the Rietveld chair has ultimately established its own known “typology” of chair-ness in architectural furniture design and has since been the prototype for other stereotypical designs over the years.<br>

            <br>What would happen if the chair’s known social context (its form, function, operability, etc.) were erased all together? What would be left? What if the parts that construct the chair are re-configured in a new way yet still provide the function of a chair? Would it still be within the type of a Rietveld Chair?-- or something else all together? Let’s explore and see!<br>
        
            <br>In the hope of promoting an individual’s personal habitus the Rietveld chair is simplified down to its inherent parts, yet provided with no directions or context as to their potential or limited use. In a way the experiment is a kit-of-parts without instructions! For instance the angled plank of wood used for sitting is instead just a plank of wood. Descriptions and details are limited to a level which would not reveal any particular use for a given part. In this way, the parts have no hierarchy, nor priority, and instead remain just parts. In addition, all assembly is unitized using a magnet-pin connection. Each part would have equal distribution of pin slots as to not provide a particular orientation or condition of use (Please refer to manual for illustrations). The kit-of-parts is now just that -- just without the instructions!<br>
        
            <br> This experiment looks to challenge the known understanding of a “chair” and instead provides the needed parts and assembly to allow for an altered interpretation of a chair. Perhaps through this direction-less assembly new and strange variations of chairs can be implemented, further questioning the use of TYPOLOGY in architectural discourse and design.</p>

        <hr class="solid_white">
            <h1> Design Strategy: Typology of Socially Programmed Institutions</h1>

            <p>Certain instances of social habit are inherent to architecturally programmed institutions of the public realm. They situate themselves within ‘common’ life and as a result can establish a known and prescriptive function of use. Examples of this can range from the public ‘Laundromat’, the ‘Barber Shop’, or even the ‘Athletic Gym’, all of which provide a clear and prescriptive function.   However, while their functions are seemingly clear their socio-economic conditions run parallel to this function. As mentioned by Thomas F. Gieryn in the chapter ‘What Buildings Do’, excerpted from the book “Theory and Society”,</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“The structuring force of the built environment comes from the spatial and architectural routinization of everyday interactions: The design of familiar places evokes and steers patterned behavioral responses.” (8*)</a>

            <p>The known familiar programmatic use of architectural institutions may be “commonly adopted” or stereotypical in their classification -- but so are their not so apparent social stigmas or perceptions. In this way socially common architectural institutions are the perfect setting to enact and challenge TYPOLOGIES in architecture and society. Through the exploration and potential reinterpretation of these sites of public/private social habit perhaps variants can be introduced to enact a more provocative architectural experience.</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“Objectification in institutions guarantee the permanence and cumulativity of material and symbolic acquisitions which can then subsist without the agents having to recreate them continuously and in their entirety by deliberate action.” (8*)</a>

            <h3>DON'T ADD TOO MUCH SOAP</h3>

            <h1>The Laundromat (#1-3)</h1>

            <p>Public Laundromats while rooted in their functionality of providing the ability to clean clothes (which is a fundamentally adopted necessity of modern living) they also seemingly perpetuate another “social program” within their environment. Laundromats have been revered as an ‘in-between’ space which because of their distinct uses are oftentimes associated stereotypically with certain groups of individuals in society.<br>

            <br>In itself this site of function is prescribed to users that clearly don’t have their own personal source of cleaning. In the era of modern 21st century technology and resources, washers and dryers are relatively common in upgraded homes. Yet, because of this reality a variety of groups are limited and inappropriately sanctioned outside of these programs. Same is true for homeless individuals all together. The laundromat becomes a public refuge to clean and reset for individuals who don’t have a distinctive home at all. Yet, why is the social stigmas between users so apparent? Is it the clear juxtaposition of personalized programmatic function of users? Is it the mixed understanding of public and private space? The laundromat is a social procession of activities - all varied because of personalized washing styles and tendencies. In this way the laundromat becomes not just a functional activity but a cultural one - embedded in an individual's personal desires and habits.<br>
        
            <br>However, the currently known format of the LAUNDROMAT is inherently static and complacent. It merely provides a backdrop for mixed public/private activities but lacks the facilities to become an agent in those activities. It's clear that the laundromat challenges the usually private domestic norms of washing clothing, but how could this space provide more to its users and the society it's situated in? Each step within the cleaning process has its own direct functional qualities and socially apparent stigmas...let's take a look at all of them!</p>

            <p>#1 The Washer Floor<br>

            <br>Situated as the initial step in the LAUNDROMAT process, the washing machine is an intimate thing. With a series of controls and settings, it's meant to adapt to the users own personal desires for cleaning materials. The act of washing is also one tied to the act of resetting or reverting to the original state. While currently a static system situated structurally to the foundation of the washing space, what if the washer became a dynamic process much like its internal functions that it provides? Perhaps the initial step in the washing process could be a configurative system that looks to promote the interactivity of users within the washer space. When a user interacts with the functional object of the washer, their manipulation of the object in space has inadvertent impacts on the manipulation of other washers in the room. The cords of the washers are tied together in a functional way - promoting the social interactivity of users through both functional and social discussions. For some the laundromat is a fairly private domestic activity. So perhaps the manipulation of the washer into a more private environment within the room.</p>

            <p>#2 The Dryer Nook <br>

            <br>The secondary step (at least the most commonly adopted one) in the LAUNDROMAT process, is the dryer. Often revered as a visual step - the dryer becomes an interface of viewing, one that allures to emotional feelings or states. What if the act of drying becomes an emotional endeavor. Much like going to the movies can often be culturally or emotionally tied - perhaps the system for drying can be instead a nook of consciousness. The functionality of viewing also allows for users to join viewing “rooms”. This could potentially promote the non-normative or habitual activity of emotionally discussing or interacting.<br>
        
            <br>#3 The Folder Wall<br>
        
            <br>The “last” step in the LAUNDROMAT process, is the folding table. While most often NOT used for folding… these semi-functional surfaces are usually used for other activities all together (some more promiscuous than others). While the surfaces have a prescribed function their perceptual nature is ultimately not considered. The surfaces are varying things for varying people - all dependent upon the habitual nature of folding (or some other programmatic function all together). The FOLDER WALL is meant to enable that promiscuousness. The reflective wall has hidden seams meant to promote the curiousness of users. For some the wall becomes purely functional… meant to allow for the folding of clothes, while for others the acting of exploring the surface of the wall promotes the non-usual use of the wall all together. In this the perceptual endeavors of each user remains personal, yet set within an all too public space.</p>

        <hr class="solid_white">

            <h1>The Athletic Gym (#4)</h1>

            <p>Performative factors of gender are inherent to the known history of society and the inhabitation of space. From some of the earliest known stereotypes of gender in regard to heteronormativity such as the gendered performance of the domestic “Nuclear Home” to other examples of gendered binaries in society that inevitably disregard queer individuals — its clear that the known framework of binaries establishes a system that doesn’t allow for equality and non-normative social interactions. According to Judith Butler from a discussion on her book “Why Bodies Matter” — Gender Trouble;</p>

            <a href="quote4" class="quote" style=color:blue>“Life is more liveable when we are not confined to categories that do not work for us… or categories that are imposed on us and take away our freedom.” (9*)</a>

            <p>It is through the known framework of gender binaries that a plethora of societal conditions are established… by viewing our environment inherently through binaries (yes/no, big, small, etc.) a system of inequality of classification is already revealed in society.<br>
            <br>The routinization of athletic equipment in the field maintains a homogeneous experience, one that doesn’t allow for both spatial and social precarity. By implementing the gym between domestic suburban dwellings the configuration promotes a new “non-space” that evokes a new mode of public and private. In this way socially constructed stereotypes surrounding both athletic activity and its architectural space can be reconstructed within an urban-suburbia. Internal partitions look to promote strangeness within the program for both individuals while also group activities.
